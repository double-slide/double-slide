## About
Hi, Iâ€™m Iaan. Iâ€™m a developer with front-end and back-end skills.

My previous career as a mechanical engineer brought me close to my current passion: creating web applications.

As an engineer, Iâ€™ve always been keen to design products that are easy to use, and easy to service. This philosophy still holds true â€“ I now strive to create quality software experiences for users, and maintainable code for other developers.

My experience with cross-discipline engineering teams means that I can quickly translate technical jargon into language that is accessible for anyone.

During my engineering degree, I used languages like Matlab and C++ to perform engineering calculations. As a working engineer, I used Python, VBA and Matlab to automate tasks and process data.

More recently, through my web development diploma, I have delivered projects using JavaScript, React, SQL, Node, Express, Ruby, and Rails.

I enjoy collaborating with enthusiastic people, and leveraging technology to create new things!
